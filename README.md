# ML_Cockroaches

First generation of cockroaches moves randomly.
Task of trainer (application user) is to kill appearing cockroaches with click/tap.
Cockroaches that survived longest periods of time propagates their moving patterns to next generations.
There is also probability of minor mutations in moving patterns between generations.

Idea is, that population will discover moving patterns that allows cockroaches to escape effectively.
